        <h3 id="200"><b>200</b> OK</h3>
        <p>The request has succeeded. The meaning of the success depends on the HTTP method:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>GET: The resource has been fetched and is transmitted in the message body.</li>
            <li>HEAD: The entity headers are in the message body.</li>
            <li>PUT or POST: The resource describing the result of the action is transmitted in the message body.</li>

        <p>The request has succeeded and a new resource has been created as a result. This is typically the response
            sent after POST requests, or some PUT requests. <a

        <h3 id="202"><b>202</b> Accepted</h3>
        <p>The request has been received but not yet acted upon. It is noncommittal, since there is no way in HTTP to
            later send an asynchronous response indicating the outcome of the request. It is intended for cases where
            another process or server handles the request, or for batch processing. <a

        <h3 id="203"><b>203</b> Non-Authoritative Information</h3>
        <p>This response code means the returned meta-information is not exactly the same as is available from the
            origin server, but is collected from a local or a third-party copy. This is mostly used for mirrors or
            backups of another resource. Except for that specific case, the "200 OK" response is preferred to this
            status. <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/203" target="_blank"

        <p>This response code means that the URI of requested resource has been changed temporarily. Further changes in

        <p>Defined in a previous version of the HTTP specification to indicate that a requested response must be

            proxy.</p>

        <hr>
        <h3 id="307"><b>307</b> Temporary Redirect</h3>
        <p>The server sends this response to direct the client to get the requested resource at another URI with same
            method that was used in the prior request. This has the same semantics as the 302 Found HTTP response code,
            with the exception that the user agent must not change the HTTP method used: If a POST was used in the first
            request, a POST must be used in the second request. <a

        <p>This means that the resource is now permanently located at another URI, specified by the Location: HTTP

            exception that the user agent must not change the HTTP method used: If a POST was used in the first request,

        <h3 id="403"><b>403</b> Forbidden</h3>
        <p>The client does not have access rights to the content; that is, it is unauthorized, so the server is refusing
            to give the requested resource. Unlike 401, the client's identity is known to the server. <a

        <h3 id="404"><b>404</b> Not Found</h3>
        <p>The server can not find the requested resource. In the browser, this means the URL is not recognized. In an
            API, this can also mean that the endpoint is valid but the resource itself does not exist. Servers may also
            send this response instead of 403 to hide the existence of a resource from an unauthorized client. This
            response code is probably the most famous one due to its frequent occurrence on the web. <a

        <p>This response is sent on an idle connection by some servers, even without any previous request by the client.
            It means that the server would like to shut down this unused connection. This response is used much more
            since some browsers, like Chrome, Firefox 27+, or IE9, use HTTP pre-connection mechanisms to speed up
            surfing. Also note that some servers merely shut down the connection without sending this message. <a

            intends this status code to be used for "limited-time, promotional services". APIs should not feel compelled
